# utilities_statement
Creates a utilities statement for each tenant in a house.
Bills, that must be paid by the residents (e.g. waste bill, building insurance, land tax etc.), are collected.
The share, each tenant has to pay, is calculated based on the underlying unit (e.g. amount of living space, number of residents) and fed into the utilities statement.
